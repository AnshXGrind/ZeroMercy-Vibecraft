# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
# Keep binary handling explicit. MP4 files were previously tracked with Git LFS
# which causes pointer files to be present on deploy platforms that don't
# automatically fetch LFS objects (like Vercel). Stop using LFS for mp4 so
# the actual video binaries are committed and served correctly.
